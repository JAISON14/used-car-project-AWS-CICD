#  Predicting Used Car Prices in Canada

-> Developed an end-to-end data science project to predict the prices of Canadian used cars using a dataset of over 225k cars, sourced from MarketCheck, which aggregates inventory from over 65k dealer websites across the US and Canada.

-> Employed a wide range of regression algorithms, evaluating 14 different models to identify the most effective approach. Identified BaggingRegressor as the optimal algorithm, delivering superior price predictions.

-> Created a user-friendly web application using Flask, providing an intuitive interface for users to input car details and receive price predictions based on the trained model.

-> Utilized Docker for seamless deployment, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

-> Successfully Deployed the application in the production environment of AWS Cloud, leveraging GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment and continuous integration.

-> Applied technical expertise in regression algorithms, Python (including Flask framework), Docker, AWS Cloud, Azure Web App, and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

-> Achieved high accuracy (r2_test score of 94.70%) in car price predictions, providing valuable insights to facilitate more informed decisions in the used car market.
